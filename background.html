        A dominant feature of the World Wide 
        Web that has made it the most successful 
        computing platform on the planet is that 
        there is a single unifying protocol that 
        underlies and connects all applications 
        running on the WWW throughout the entire 
        world.  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
        (HTTP) is used by all servers and browsers 
        on the WWW.  HTTP is a simple set of rules 
        that allows every one of the billions of hosts 
        running on the WWW to have access to every 
        other host.  It is this simple underlying 
        unification mechanism that has made web 
        applications the predominant form of delivery 
        for modern software applications. A dominant feature of the World Wide
